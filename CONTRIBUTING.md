# Contributing the Dictionary of Anchulleti

Thank you for your contributing to our dictionary! This project aims to document and preserve our unique language style in a way that's maybe not always respectful, but inclusive, and fun for all. Please take a moment to review these guidelines before contributing.  

## Guidelines for Adding New Words

### Step 1: Create an Issue Before Adding a Word

**Open an Issue:** Before submitting a pull request (PR) to add a new slang word, please create an issue. This helps others see that someone is working on that word to avoid duplicate efforts.  

**Check Existing Issues:** Review open issues to see if your word is already in progress.  

### Step 2: Define the Word in the Existing Style

**Follow Existing Format:** Please ensure that your definition follows the style and tone of existing entries in the dictionary. This includes:  
- **Headword:** The main word or phrase being defined.
- **Definition:** A concise explanation of the word or phrase.
- **Etymology:** Provide a brief origin of the word, such as its roots or initial usage.
- **Example Usage:** A brief example that illustrates how the word is used in context.
- **Pronunciation (optional):** If the pronunciation is unique or challenging, include a phonetic guide.
- **Synonims (optinal):** List any related words or phrases with similar meanings within the local community's slang.

### Step 3: Ensure Definitions Are Respectful and Privacy-Conscious

- **Respect Privacy:** Definitions should not violate anyone’s privacy or include sensitive information.

- **Avoid Offensive Content:** If a word’s definition includes language that could insult or target an individual or group, avoid it unless it's specific to **Anchulleti** or **Baizak and his team**.  

- **Flag Inappropriate Content:** If an etymology of a word violates these guidelines, add the note:  
    
        The origin of this word cannot be given because it may offend its source or co-source.

## Submission Policy

### To ensure a smooth workflow and minimize conflicts:

- **Limit of Active PRs:** Limit yourself to two open PRs at a time. Once a PR is approved or merged, you can submit another.

- **Updating Existing Words:** For changes to existing words (such as clarifying definitions or improving examples), create an issue to propose the changes before submitting a PR.

- **Feedback and Revisions:** If a reviewer requests changes to your PR, please address them within 14 days. If you’re unable to, let the reviewer know to avoid stalling the review process.

- **Abandoned PRs:** PRs without updates after 30 days may be closed by maintainers. You’re welcome to reopen them later if needed or kick a maintainer physically.

## Reporting Issues

If you notice an issue with an existing word (e.g., errors, missing information, inappropriate content), please create an issue. When reporting, include details such as:

- Word in question
- Description of the issue (e.g., spelling error, missing example)
- Suggested corrections, if any
